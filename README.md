# Fedreal_Reserve_Meeting_minutes
Webscrapes of the Federal Reserve meeting minutes since 2014



This repository scrapes the Federal Reserve webpage (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) and pulls all the meeting minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee since 2014. The notes can be found of in the fed_mins_2019_08_25.csv (the date the data was pulled was on 08/25/2019). I learned most of the techniques for this project from https://www.datacamp.com/courses/web-scraping-with-python and https://synechron.udemy.com/web-scraping-in-python-using-scrapy-and-splash/.
