# Fedreal_Reserve_Meeting_minutes Project
Web scrapes of the Federal Reserve meeting minutes


### fed_mins_notes
This repository scrapes the Federal Reserve webpage (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) and pulls all the meeting minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee since 2014. The notes can be found of in the fed_mins_2019_08_25.csv (the date the data was pulled was on 08/25/2019). I learned most of the techniques for this project from https://www.datacamp.com/courses/web-scraping-with-python.
